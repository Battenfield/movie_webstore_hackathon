# Movie Webstore Hackathon
##movie_webstore_hackathon
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a Remote Prep hackathon project that a group of 4 of us built.  We were to build a store website using our knowledge of functions and data structures in 2.5 hours.  We completed our task dynamically appending divs of our movie products using jQuery.  After our presentation of our work we took the webstore further to add a movie API to get our data from an array of movie titles.  Once we created our movie objects using the API we appended them dynamically in genre categories.
